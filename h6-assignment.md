## X. Summaries

## a. Install TOR

1. I googled tor browser installation
2. Chose the link that redirected to the installation page
3. Clicked download button and chose download for Linux, since I am browsing with virtual machine

5. I lost many screenshots and comments im between since my virtual machine crashed before I was able to commit the changes in this file

6. I had to move out from virtual machine as it did not have enough power to start and also all my downloads disappeared so I had to start all over again

7. Now I installed the TOR for Windows, and opened it:

**search engine for onion sites**
 DuckDuckGo is being used as a search engine in Tor:

Another one is Ahmia

**human rights or civil rights organization**
I searched from DuckDuckGo and clicked Amnesty, the browser suggested me to use onion site so I did that

**marketplace**
Found this site that has onion links to marketplaces

None of those links worked so I opened AHMIA searvh engine and searched from there

Found it from ahmia

**forum**
Searching from Ahmia I found this "hackers room", doesnt seem to be that popular since only one online, maybe its me

**a well known organization (with regular postal addresses, offices or similar presence outside darknet)**

There were this button to move to onion site
