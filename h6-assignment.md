# H6 assignment

## X. Summaries

## a. Install TOR

1. Googled "tor browser installation"
2. Chose the link that redirected to the installation page
3. Clicked download button and chose download for Linux, since I am browsing with virtual machine

5. Lost some screenshots and steps, since my virtual machine crashed. I started to install the tor again, but my virtual machine is just slow and TOR won't start

6. Decided to try to install without virtual machine. My testing laptop is ready to go to trash anyway :)

7. Installed the TOR for Windows, and clicked "Finish":

8. After clicking the "Finish" button the TOR opened just like that

## b) Browse TOR network

- **Search engine for onion sites**

When the TOR opened, DuckDuckGo was suggested to be used as a search engine:

I also tried Ahmia, which seemed to have easier access to onion sites

- **Human rights or civil rights organization**

I searched with those words in DuckDuckGo and Amnesty was one of the first options.

(I first landed on "original" amnesty site, but saw this button to move to onion site:)

- **Marketplace**

I ended up to this site which had a list of different marketplaces and their onion site links:

However, none of those links worked so I opened Ahmia search engine and searched marketplaces from there. Found this:

- **Fraud**
  My thought is that TOR is quite full of frauds. Teacher showed during the class that every single "serial killer" site is fraud, so I don't think I need a screenshot of such site here.

- **Forum**

Searched forums from Ahmia and I found this "hackers room":

It doesn't seem to be that popular since there is only one online (me? :D)

- **A well known organization (with regular postal addresses, offices or similar presence outside darknet)**

Maybe New York times magazine fits for this section?:
