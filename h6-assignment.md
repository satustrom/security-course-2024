## X. Summaries

## a. Install TOR

1. I googled tor browser installation
2. Chose the link that redirected to the installation page
3. Clicked download button and chose download for Linux, since I am browsing with virtual machine

5. I lost many screenshots and comments im between since my virtual machine crashed before I was able to commit the changes in this file

6. I had to move out from virtual machine as it did not have enough power to start and also all my downloads disappeared so I had to start all over again

7. Now I installed the TOR for Windows, and opened it:

**search engine for onion sites**
 DuckDuckGo is being used as a search engine in Tor:

**human rights or civil rights organization**
I searched from DuckDuckGo and clicked Amnesty, the browser suggested me to use onion site so I did that
