#### **[Darknet Diaries, EP 1: The Phreaky World of PBX Hacking:](https://darknetdiaries.com/transcript/75/)**

- PBX = Private Branch Exchange, an internal telephone network
- VOIP phones = Voice-over IP phones = instead of old telephone system, the phone is plugged into the regular office network
- PBX Hacking = A hacker sets up call forwarding to a company's VOIP phone PBX system so that the phone calls get forwarded to the hacker's own expensive numbers and is able to charge the company for it. Hackers use robo-dialers and therefore can make enormous amounts of phone calls in company's phone bill
- Vulnerabilities in the VOIP = company's ineptitude to configure the PBX safely, is allowing this kind of hacking to happen
- Securing a PBX is quite complicated since it must be on the interned in order to receive incoming calls, also some workers have the system at home which complicates the set up even more
- It is hard to catch PBX Hackers for many reasons, for example forwarderd calls are most often dialed to foreign countries and the police are not equipped to hadle international crimes
- Farhan Arshad and Noor Aziz Uddin were arrested for PBX hacking in Pakistan in 2015, but there are still thousands of other PBX hackers free without any idea who and where they are
