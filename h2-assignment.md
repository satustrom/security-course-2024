#### **[Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/applied-cryptography-protocols/9781119096726/10_chap02.html#chap02-sec004):**

**2.5 Communications Using Public-Key Cryptography**

- Public-key cryptography means having a key pair which can be used to encrypt and decrypt content. With the public key the content can be encrypted and it can only be decrypted with the matching private key. Public-key cryptography is asymmetric.
- Symmetric-key cryptography means encrypting and decrypting the content with the same algorithm and key. Symmetric-key cryptography is much faster and less vulnerable than public-key cryptography.
- Hybrid cryptosystem is a combination of public-key cryptography and symmetric-key cryptography: Public key (A) is being used to encrypt another key (B), and B is being used to encrypt the content. Both the content and the B will be sent to recipient. In order to read the content, private key is used to decrypt the B and finally with decrypted B the content can also be decrypted.

**2.6 Digital signatures**

- Documents could be signed digitally with a system between the person who signed and the recipient. The person who signed, would encrypt the document with public key, the system would decrypt it with matching private key, encrypt it again with another public key, which private key the recipient has. The system between would be not only slow but vulnerable in the long run since it would contain a lot of sensitive information the more documents get signed.
- Faster and safer solution would be to use hashes of the documents and send it straight to the recipient without the decryption and encryption in between. Public-Key Cryptography would be used to encrypt and decrypt the hash.

**2.7 Digital signatures with encryption**

- Integrating digital signatures with public-key cryptography makes a protocol that ensures both encrypted security and verified authenticity.
- Two key pairs would be used: One for signing and verifying the signature and one to encrypt and decrypt the signed message.

**2.8 Random And Pseudo-Random-Sequence Generation**

- Issue with a random-number generator is it doesn't produce a random sequence. Random-number generators are periodic and periodic means predictable.
- A pseudo-random sequence generator produces sequences that appear random but are generated by a deterministic process. To be effective, these sequences should not repeat over short lengths and should resemble true randomness in properties like bit distribution, run lengths, and unpredictability, which can be statistically tested to ensure they meet randomness criteria.
- A sequence generator is pseudo-random if the generated sequence looks random so that it passes the statistical tests of randomness.
- In order sequence to be cryptographically secure pseudo-random it should also be unpredictable and computationally infeasible to predict the upcoming random bits.
- According to O'reilly, The sequence is real random only if it also cannot be reliably reproduced.

- Digital signature contains three phases: Preparation, signing and verifying. Preparation contains creating the private and public key (and handing over the public key), signing contains creating the sign with the private key, and verifying contains checking the signature with the public key.
- A key pair is created once but it can be used several times
- A key pair can be created by first creating a private key. The private key is a large secret random number. The public key will be calculated from the private key.
- "Hello" => encrypted with the private key => "asks398fja8212jdwc" => decrypted with the public key => "Hello"
- The keys can be used both ways: The content can also be encrypted with the public key.
- Digital signatures could be attacked by stealing the private key and behaving like the original owner of the private key.

#### **[Karvinen 2023: PGP - Send Encrypted and Signed Message - gpg](https://terokarvinen.com/2023/pgp-encrypt-sign-verify/):**

- gpg = GNU privacy guard, generally used to encrypt messages
- Gpg can be used in command line but also via additional tools for everyday messaging
- The article also shows an example of sending a encrypted message between two people via command line tools

## a) Pubkey today

An example of how I have used public key cryptography today:

- Chatting with my friend in Whatsapp
- When I sent the message, it got encrypted asymmetrically. The message was mixed up using m friend's magic lock (public key) before it got sent over the internet. My friend decrypted it with matching private key. ([Nayak, A, 8.2.2024: Asymmetric Encryption — Whatsapp mechanism](https://medium.com/@anoopnayak1/asymmetric-encryption-whatsapp-mechanism-79d1821e765c#:~:text=When%20you%20send%20a%20message,can%20unlock%20and%20read%20it.))
